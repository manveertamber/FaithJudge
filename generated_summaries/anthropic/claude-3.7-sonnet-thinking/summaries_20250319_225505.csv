14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". "" In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","# Summary: Hospital Attack in Afghanistan

Armed militants from the Islamic State (IS) attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, beginning when one attacker detonated explosives at the gate before gunmen opened fire on staff and patients. Afghan commandos responded, killing all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The attack left more than 50 wounded, while the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the assault, stating it ""trampled all human values."" 

This attack marks a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan, as it's their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul, previously focusing on civilian targets. Since establishing presence in Afghanistan in 2015, IS has conducted several major attacks, including bombings at a rally (80 killed), during Ashura (30 killed), at a mosque (30+ killed), and at the Supreme Court (22 killed). Meanwhile, the Taliban continues its own offensive in the region."
14-1,"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. "" It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. "" The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). "" John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. "" It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall. will be on the BBC News Channel from 2130 BST and on BBC Arts.","# Booker Prize 2014 Shortlist Summary

14-2,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. ""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay. ""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. ""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors. ""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","# Summary of Mark Carney's Bank of England Term Extension

Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension to his term rather than either leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying until 2021. This decision was primarily driven by personal considerations - in 2018, two of his daughters will be completing important educational milestones (A-levels and GCSEs), making it an ideal time for his family to return to Canada. 

While Carney recognized it would be problematic to leave mid-Brexit negotiations in 2018, he felt he could only extend his stay by one year beyond his family's departure. By 2019, the Article 50 process should be complete, allowing a new Governor to take over. Those close to Carney dismissed speculation about tensions with Prime Minister Theresa May or that criticism of the Bank's Brexit forecasts influenced his decision."
14-3,"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. "" Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. "" Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. "" There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". "" The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. "" In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","# Adrian Gill: Celebrated Sunday Times Columnist Dies After Cancer Diagnosis

Adrian Gill, a prominent Sunday Times columnist known for his dazzling and fearless writing, has died following his recent cancer diagnosis. Last month, he had revealed he was suffering from what he called the ""full English"" of cancers and was undergoing chemotherapy.

Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens described Gill as ""a giant among journalists"" and ""the heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. Despite being controversial, Gill was widely respected for his distinctive writing style, with fellow journalists praising his brilliance and unmistakable voice. He famously dictated his articles by telephone due to his dyslexia.

Throughout his career, Gill sparked numerous controversies with provocative comments about Welsh people, Norfolk, the Isle of Man, and for describing shooting a baboon in Tanzania.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill was previously married to author Cressida Connolly and later to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children. His illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins."
14-4,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "" I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

The passage details three main hacking groups operating in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, each claiming independence from government entities:

**Ukrainian Cyber Troops** led by programmer Yevhen Dokukin hack Russian government servers, use DDoS attacks against rebel websites, and monitor separatist areas through compromised CCTV systems. They target rebel funding by infiltrating payment systems and recently hijacked printers to distribute pro-Ukrainian messages.

**Cyber Berkut**, a pro-Russian group named after riot police used against Kiev protesters, focuses on disrupting Ukrainian government operations. Their activities include hacking government websites during Biden's visit to Kiev, compromising electronic billboards to display graphic war imagery, and allegedly interfering with election systems.

**Anonymous International** (also known as ""Humpty Dumpty"") primarily leaks Kremlin documents, though it's unclear whether through hacking or insider sources. They've released materials about Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine, including communications from a prominent rebel commander.

Ukrainian officials deny using hacker-obtained intelligence for military operations, despite some reports suggesting otherwise."

15-3,"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . 
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . 
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . 
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . 
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . 
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . 
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . 
opinion : why are more women drinking ? 
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . 
"" it 's really , really scary . "" 
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . 
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . 
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . 
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . 
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) . 
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . 
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . 
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . 
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui . 
they think they have control over it . "" 
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . 
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . 
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . 
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . 
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . 
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . 
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . 
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . 
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . 
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control .

A study by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation revealed that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with women's drinking rates rising particularly fast. Nationwide, women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate of men over the decade.

The first study to track adult drinking at the county level found that in 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, with significant regional variations. Despite this increase in excessive consumption, the percentage of Americans who drink any alcohol remained relatively stable.

Experts attribute these trends to changing social norms making heavy drinking more acceptable for women, affluence (particularly in tech-heavy areas), cheaper alcohol in real dollars, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study analyzed data from approximately 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older."

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles . 
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title . 
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium . 
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision . 
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 . 
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even . 
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' . 
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief . 
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out . 
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement . 
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving . 
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab . 
voom , i 'd snap it back again . 
he 'd try to get me on the ropes . 
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . ' 
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated . 
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face . 
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside . 
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . ' 
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned . 
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible . 
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in . 
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight . 
he quit because he was embarrassed . ' 
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action . 
television commercials featuring him were taken off . 
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem . 
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title . 
rejoicing returned to the streets . 
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title . 
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas . 
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","# Leonard vs. Duran: The Historic ""No Mas"" Fight

This passage discusses the significance of the Roberto Duran vs. Sugar Ray Leonard rivalry, highlighting their second bout on November 25, 1980, at the Louisiana Superdome as one of boxing's most important historical fights.

After a controversial first match where Duran won by a disputed decision, Leonard changed tactics in the rematch. Instead of engaging in a slugfest, Leonard utilized his superior speed and movement to frustrate Duran. In the eighth round, following Leonard's taunting and precise punches, Duran unexpectedly turned his back and quit, uttering the infamous words ""No mas"" (no more).

This shocking surrender damaged Duran's reputation in his native Panama, taking him three years to regain national esteem by winning the world light-middleweight title. Leonard would later win their third encounter in 1989, but considered forcing Duran to quit as his greatest achievement in their trilogy, saying it was ""better than knocking him out.""

The passage positions this fight as part of boxing's golden age in the middleweight divisions, alongside other historic bouts that shaped the sport."
16-1,"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam . 
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career . 
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods . 
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland . 
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year . 
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions . 
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome . 
it would just be incredible . 
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much . 
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . ' 
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round . 
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket . 
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added . 
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time . 
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed . 
` and not just one . 
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on . 
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . ' 
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel . 
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year . 
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added . 
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much . 
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot . 
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position . 
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out . 
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . ' 
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february . 
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki
and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta . 
` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped . 
it really did , ' he added . 
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen . 
` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf . 
there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play . '","# McIlroy Seeks Masters Victory to Complete Career Grand Slam

World number one Rory McIlroy believes it is ""unthinkable"" that he won't win the Masters during his career to complete the rare career grand slam, achieved by only five players in history (Sarazen, Hogan, Player, Nicklaus, and Woods). The 25-year-old considers his final-round collapse at Augusta in 2011 ""the most important day"" of his career, as the lessons learned helped him win his first major two months later. Despite having only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy is confident in eventually winning multiple green jackets. He plans to use the golf course as a ""sanctuary"" from the pressure and hype surrounding the tournament, similar to how he managed personal distractions during his successful 2014 season."

but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million . 
the ` unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive egerton place , is described as ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space . 
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden . 
the property is being sold by russell simpson for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in stanmore , middlesex . 
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease . 
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 . 
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease .

the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity . 
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner . 
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users . 
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . ' 
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million . 
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million . 
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 . 
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange . 
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty . 
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 . 
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases .

` it is a very quirky situation . 
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge . 
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much . 
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","# Summary: Knightsbridge Apartment's Unusual Listing

A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London (one of Britain's most expensive areas) is being sold for just £575,000 - far below market value for the neighborhood. The catch is that the property has only three years left on its lease. At this price, it costs approximately £191,000 per year or £15,000 monthly, comparable to rental rates in the area.

The ""unmodernised"" 1,990 sq/ft maisonette features three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift access, parking, and communal garden. It's one of two short-lease properties being sold on Egerton Place, with the second larger property priced at £595,000.

Despite his injuries, Parkinson spends 12 hours daily in rehabilitation, walks with crutches, and raises money for military charities as patron of the Pilgrim Bandits. His mother Diane described the public response as ""phenomenal,"" with thousands joining the Pilgrim Bandits website and sending messages of support. Facebook suggested he create a page rather than a profile since he has become a public figure. Parkinson is one of 8,000 people carrying the Olympic flame during its 70-day journey to London's opening ceremony on July 27."

But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. ""Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. "" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. ""With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. "" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. ""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. ""Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. "" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. ""Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. ""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""","# Scotland Women's Football Team Close to Historic Qualification

Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifiers and is on the verge of securing their first major tournament appearance. Forward Lisa Evans, who plays for Bayern Munich, expresses how ""devastating"" it would be to miss out again after previous play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the World Cup.

The team hosts Iceland (ranked 20th, one spot above Scotland) in a crucial match at Falkirk Stadium, with both teams currently unbeaten in qualifying. Scotland appears well-positioned to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands, potentially without requiring a play-off.

The national team benefits from having 12 players competing in top leagues abroad, including Evans who recently celebrated winning the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. She believes this international experience enhances the squad as they pursue their historic qualification goal."

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","# Summary: Italy Earthquake
