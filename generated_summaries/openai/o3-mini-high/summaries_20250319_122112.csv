14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at a hospital gate and then opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital ""trampled all human values"". "" In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,"" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker ""wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors"". One employee wrote on Facebook: ""Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us."" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to ""avenge the blood of our people"". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.","Four militants attacked the 400-bed Sardar Daud Hospital in Afghanistan around 09:00 local time by first detonating explosives at the gate and then storming inside with guns and grenades. Eyewitnesses described one attacker in a white coat, and over 50 people were injured before commandos landed on the roof and, after several hours of fighting, killed all four attackers. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, marking a new tactic by directly engaging security forces in the capital—a move that contrasts with its previous focus on targeting civilian gatherings and Shia communities. While the Taliban denied involvement, President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a violation of sacred humanitarian principles, and the incident raises fears of more such assaults as IS appears to be expanding its operational capabilities."
14-1,"Mukherjee's The Lives Of Others, a sweeping account of life in 1960s Calcutta, is 5/2 favourite to win with bookmakers William Hill. It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as ""What Happened, If It Happened"". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. "" It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,"" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. "" The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). "" John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. "" It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books."" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall. will be on the BBC News Channel from 2130 BST and on BBC Arts.","The passage outlines this year’s 46th Booker Prize shortlist, which—open for the first time to all authors writing in English regardless of nationality—features a range of international works. Mukherjee’s The Lives of Others, a novel set against the backdrop of 1960s Calcutta and political activism, is the betting favorite at 5/2 odds. Other nominees include Howard Jacobson’s futuristic love story J, Ali Smith’s How To Be Both (which interweaves a 15th-century Italian narrative with that of a 1960s child), Joshua Ferris’s To Rise Again at a Decent Hour focusing on atheism and modern identity, Karen Joy Fowler’s best-selling family drama We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, and Australia’s Richard Flanagan with his war-era love story The Narrow Road to the Deep North. The passage also highlights sales increases following the shortlist announcement, critiques of the list’s overall strength, and debates about literary merit versus readability.

14-2,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. ""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay. ""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. ""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors. ""Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.","Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, opted to extend his term by just one year rather than staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as originally planned. Although an extended tenure might have offered market stability during the Brexit negotiations, his decision was driven entirely by personal reasons—specifically concerns about his family's needs and his daughters’ educational milestones. Despite speculation about political or economic pressures, Carney maintained that his choice was a private matter, ensuring he could fully devote himself to his role until Brexit (Article 50) was completed."
14-3,"The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the ""full English"" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not ""feel cheated"" and had been ""very lucky"" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: ""It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. "" Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all."" He added: ""He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. "" Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him."" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had ""an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. "" There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy."" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a ""controversialist"" but also ""a kind man and a brilliant writer"". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as ""the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times"". "" The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,"" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been ""the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style"". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. "" In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine."" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: ""Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour."" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had ""trashed"" him for 20 years, but always did so ""with magnificently eloquent savagery"" as well as ""an irritating kernel of truth"". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as ""dark, ugly little trolls"" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as ""a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile"". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the ""hernia on the end of England"", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it ""smelled of boiled washing"". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a ""dyke on a bike"". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been ""surprisingly excited"" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as ""The Blonde"" in his restaurant reviews.","Adrian Gill, a renowned and often controversial journalist for the Sunday Times, died suddenly this morning after battling multiple types of cancer—a condition he wryly described as the ""full English."" Despite undergoing chemotherapy, he remained stoic and even expressed gratitude for his life. Known for his fearless, witty, and dazzling writing style (which sometimes sparked controversy with provocative remarks), Gill was widely admired by colleagues and peers, with tributes highlighting his intelligence, compassion, and unique voice. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, he overcame dyslexia to build a notable career that began with art reviews and later included work for Tatler and the Sunday Times (which he joined in 1993). In his personal life, he was first married to author Cressida Connolly, then to Amber Rudd (with whom he had two children), and was recently engaged to long-term partner Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins.

14-4,"Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "" I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master."" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, use tactics like distributed denial‐of‐service (DDoS) attacks, hacking into Russian ministry and police systems, commandeering CCTV cameras, and even hijacking network printers to disseminate pro-Ukrainian messages. Their actions have led to large data leaks, which activist groups like Inform Napalm have analyzed for evidence of Russian military involvement. In contrast, Cyber Berkut—a group with an anti-Western, pro-Russian stance—has targeted Ukrainian government websites during high-profile events, hacked electronic billboards and vote-counting systems, and claimed to have leaked documents related to U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Additionally, the Russian activist group Anonymous International (also known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay) is noted for publishing leaked Kremlin documents and emails, further highlighting the use of cyber operations to impact narratives on both sides of the conflict."

15-3,"( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . 
heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . 
the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . 
binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . 
the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . 
in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . 
nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . 
opinion : why are more women drinking ? 
"" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , "" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . 
"" it 's really , really scary . "" 
the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . 
in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . 
despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . 
madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . 
hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) . 
related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink
about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . 
the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . 
she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . 
still , she noted , "" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui . 
they think they have control over it . "" 
public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . 
as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . 
young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . 
so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . 
taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . 
alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . 
a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . 
alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . 
that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where "" blue laws "" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . 
to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . 
kaiser health news ( khn ) is a nonprofit national health policy news service .","A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with binge drinking—defined by the CDC as 4+ drinks for women and 5+ for men on a single occasion—rising most sharply among women. Although the overall percentage of alcohol consumers remained stable, county-level data revealed significant variations, with some areas showing much higher rates of heavy and binge drinking. Researchers attribute the trend to changing social norms, economic factors (such as increased disposable income and cheaper alcohol due to stagnant taxes), expanded alcohol advertising, and weakened control policies. The study analyzed responses from about 3.7 million adults and also noted substantial public health costs, including 88,600 alcohol-attributed deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion per year."

Widnes built a 14–6 lead at halftime with tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van, and Chris Bridge. In the second half, Castleford’s loanee Paddy Flynn (on loan from Widnes) scored early and later completed a hat‐trick, while Luke Gale and Larne Patrick added further Castleford tries in a four-minute spell. However, additional scores from Widnes—tries from Ah Van, two from Lloyd White and one from Joe Mellor, including a 26‐point spur after a quick kick‐off mistake by Castleford—ensured they held on for a 38–12 win. The result marked Castleford’s fourth consecutive home league defeat, with the standings showing Widnes moving above Wakefield into seventh while Castleford remain in sixth, one point ahead of the Vikings."

sugar ray leonard v roberto duran
the first two of the three fights between the sugar man and hands of stone raised the curtain on what is considered the golden age of boxing in the classic middling weights of boxing , with ray leonard , roberto duran , thomas hearns and marvin hagler engaging each other in some of the ring 's epic battles . 
by way of a preview , leonard had defeated the previous -- and equally great -- felix trinidad to win the world welterweight title . 
sugar ray leonard celebrates after roberto duran quit in their fight in louisiana in november 1980
leonard decided to use his exceptional speed and movement to beat the panamanian in the second fight
october 30 , 1974 , kinshasa , zaire
march 8 , 1971 , madison square garden , new york
july 4 , 1910 , reno , nevada
june 22 , 1938 , yankee stadium , new york
october 1 , 1975 , quezon city , philippines
in his first defence , sugar ray had been contentiously outpointed by duran in montreal 's olympic stadium . 
so confused was the scoring that the result was first announced as a majority decision . 
that was changed to unanimous in duran 's favour after one judge was found to have totalled his score incorrectly and his card was altered from a draw to 148-147 . 
there was more uproar when that judge was revealed to have marked just three rounds in favour of duran and only two for leonard -- with 10 even . 
that was described as ` a monument to indecision ' . 
come the inevitable rematch eight months later , in the louisana superdome in new orleans on november 25 , 1980 , controversy was to be replaced by disbelief . 
leonard had gambled in the first fight by taking the macho decision to take on the panamanian hard man in a mano-a-mano slug-out . 
second time around he wisely chose to use his exceptional ability , especially his speed and movement . 
duran became frustrated as leonard danced around him before unleashing his punches
after being caught flush in the face in the eighth round , duran turned his back and said ` no mas '
` the whole fight i was moving . 
then voom , i 'd snap his head back with a jab . 
voom , i 'd snap it back again . 
he 'd try to get me on the ropes . 
i 'd pivot , spin off and pow , come under with a punch . ' 
so it went for more than seven rounds , with duran becoming increasingly frustrated . 
in the eighth leonard cranked up the psychological pressure by waving his right arm in circles and then planting a left flush in duran 's face . 
there had been a moment earlier when leonard appeared to pat him playfully on the backside . 
just before the bell duran turned his back and walked to his corner , waving his arms to indicate he was finished and famously telling the referee : ` no mas . ' 
leonard celebrates after his opponent quit , and said it was more of an achievement than knocking duran out
the result stunned the watching world , and it took three years for duran to rebuild his reputation
the watching world was stunned . 
here was one of the most heroic warriors in boxing history quitting in the most humiliating manner possible . 
sensing the reaction duran claimed he had stomach cramps caused by eating too heavily after the morning weigh-in . 
but his manager carlos eleta said : ` he always eats like that before a fight . 
he quit because he was embarrassed . ' 
duran had been a national icon in panama and there was anger on the streets at his action . 
television commercials featuring him were taken off . 
it took three years for duran to restore his high place in his country 's esteem . 
he did so on june 16 , 1983 , his 32nd birthday , by knocking out davey moore in las vegas to win the world light-middleweight title . 
rejoicing returned to the streets . 
leonard would win their third fight in 1989 by a points landslide , thereby retaining the world super-middleweight title . 
but sugar ray took most pride from the trilogy from forcing duran to say no mas . 
he said : ` to me , making roberto duran to quit was better than knocking him out . '","The passage juxtaposes two defining moments in boxing history. It first discusses the much-anticipated Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao fight, hailed as the biggest and most significant bout of the century whose ultimate place in boxing lore will depend on its actual execution and the many surrounding political, social, and cultural factors. The passage then recounts the classic rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran during boxing’s golden age. It details how their first fight was marred by controversial scoring, and their 1980 rematch became legendary when Leonard’s superior speed and movement led to Duran quitting mid-fight by saying “no mas.” This dramatic moment shocked the world and temporarily damaged Duran’s reputation until he later redeemed himself, while Leonard later secured a third win and stated that forcing Duran to quit was his proudest achievement."
16-1,"rory mcilroy believes it is ` unthinkable ' that he will not win the masters at some point to complete the career grand slam . 
and the world number one has revealed how his final-round collapse at augusta national in 2011 was the most important day of his career . 
mcilroy is looking to claim his first green jacket and become just the sixth player to win all four major titles after gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus and tiger woods . 
rory mcilroy tees off at the arnold palmer invitational golf tournament in orlando on march 19
` for me now it 's a career-long goal to win there to achieve something that only a handful of players have ever achieved , ' the 25-year-old said in an interview with bbc northern ireland . 
` there 's something special i can achieve going into augusta this year . 
you are a complete player if you can win every major because they are on different golf courses , different tests , different conditions . 
not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome . 
it would just be incredible . 
` you feel the sense of what can be achieved but i ca n't think about that too much . 
i just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as i can and if i can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else 's . ' 
mcilroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six masters appearances , finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored by his marker in the third round . 
mcilroy is hoping to complete his grand slam of majors with a victory at augusta later this month
but the 25-year-old can not picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted green jacket . 
` during my career , yes it 's unthinkable , ' he added . 
` if i do n't win it this year ... either it 's not the right time or it is n't your time . 
if i was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a green jacket i 'd obviously be very , very disappointed . 
` and not just one . 
i feel like it 's a course i can do very well at and a golf course i can hopefully win multiple times on . 
obviously getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others . ' 
mcilroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago , only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner charl schwartzel . 
but he bounced back to win his first major title by eight shots in the us open two months later , before adding wins in the 2012 us pga and both the open and us pga last year . 
mcilroy is hoping to emulate the likes of jack nicklaus ( above ) by winning all four major titles
` i think it was the most important day of my career , ' he added . 
` if i had n't had the whole unravelling and say i just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one , i might not have learnt as much . 
` but for it all to come apart how it did i learnt an awful lot . 
i learnt so much about myself and my game and what i needed to do differently the next time i was in that position . 
` luckily it did n't take me long to get into a position like that again where i was leading a major and we know how that one played out . 
i was able to get over the line pretty comfortably . ' 
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to caroline wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company which cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in february . 
mcilroy 's extraordinary success last year came he called off his wedding to caroline wozniacki
and he hopes he can again use the golf course as his ` sanctuary ' from the pressure and hype surrounding augusta . 
` the golf course was my sanctuary , it was where i could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours that i am out there and it helped . 
it really did , ' he added . 
` i was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and i think it will be the same at augusta because there will be so much hype and build up and talk about what could happen . 
` i know i wo n't be able to wait until thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the golf course and play golf . 
there is only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and try and play .

Despite having only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, he is determined to claim his first green jacket at Augusta National, a course he considers his sanctuary. McIlroy reflected on his 2011 final‐round collapse, labeling it the most important day of his career for the lessons it taught him, and now he aims to join the select group of players who have won all four major championships."

16-4,"a three-bedroom apartment in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain has been put on the market for just £ 575,000 - but the ` bargain ' property comes with a catch . 
the knightsbridge flat , london , which is on sale for a fraction of the price of neighbouring homes , has just three years left on the lease . 
the cost would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area . 
the entrance to the flats in one of the most expensive areas to live in britain where a three-bedroom apartment has been put on the market for just £ 575,000
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the property could be worth upwards of £ 6 million . 
the ` unmodernised ' maisonette in the in exclusive egerton place , is described as ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space . 
it boasts three bedrooms , two bathrooms , a reception room and utility room along with a lift , parking and a communal garden . 
the property is being sold by russell simpson for £ 575,000 - the same price as a three-bedroom house in stanmore , middlesex . 
it is one of two maisonettes being sold with three years remaining on the lease . 
both homes will need to be modernised , with the second , larger property - also on egerton place - on the market for £ 595,000 . 
the next cheapest three-bedroom property in knightsbridge costs £ 1.5 million , and this flat is only offered with a 28-year lease . 
but the property comes with a catch , not only is it in dire need of renovation , ( such as in one of its bedrooms , pictured ) the home has just three years left on the lease
the cost for £ 575,000 on a three year lease would work out at £ 191,000 per year , or £ 15,000 per month - which is around the going rate for renting a three-bedroom flat in the area , plus renovation works which are needed , such as in the living room ( pictured )
but if any buyer decides to extend the lease , the ` bright and well proportioned ' property with 1,990 sq/ft of space , could be worth upwards of £ 6 million
jake russell , from russell simpson , said : ` properties like this come up once in a blue moon and i think it is an outstanding opportunity . 
` to get properties like this in egerton place is very exciting and the phone has n't stopped ringing , which is quite unusual considering the time of the year with the election around the corner . 
` we have had interest from locals , developers and end users . 
in modernised condition , we would estimate they would sell for between £ 2,750 and £ 3,000 per sq/ft . ' 
this gives the smaller property a £ 6 million prices tag , while the larger maisonette with 2,500 sq/ft of space could be worth £ 7.5 million . 
the current freeholder is thought to be the welcome trust and any buyer would have to negotiate a lease extension with them and , for a 90-year lease , it is likely to cost between £ 3.35 and £ 4.5 million . 
egerton place was built off michael 's grove by john grover and son to the designs of architect mervyn macartney around 1893 . 
the properties introduced a higher quality of architecture to the egerton gardens area with each home featuring four main storeys with basements and garrets , finished in costly two-inch bricks of red and orange . 
estate agents said it was rare for properties with such short leases to come on the market and the phone ` has n't stopped ringing ' about the egerton place apartment
but alex newall , from hanover private office , had a warning to potential buyers : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease '
leases of all the homes were granted by the smith 's charity trustees in 1894 , and its first occupant was , sir evan macgregor , permanent secretary to the admiralty . 
other residents of high status included the dowager lady lawrence , probably the widow of the first baron lawrence , at no. 5 , and sir henry fielding dickens , q.c. , son of the novelist charles at no. 2 . 
one property consultant said it was very rare for a pair of properties to come onto the market with such short leases . 
alex newall , from hanover private office , said : ` it looks cheap , but there will be a massive premium to pay to extend the lease . 
` a developer will probably buy it or someone might use it as a rental for three years and then give it back to the freeholder . 
` it is a very quirky situation . 
properties do come up with very short leases like this every so often but it is very rare for somewhere like knightsbridge . 
` i know someone who let their lease run down to eight years and they thought ` right , i need to extend it ' , but by then it was too late and the extension was too much . 
` let it be a warning to check your lease . '","A three-bedroom maisonette in Egerton Place, Knightsbridge, is listed for £575,000. Despite its attractive price—considerably lower than nearby properties—it comes with a major drawback: only three years remain on its lease, which effectively costs about £191,000 per year, similar to local rental rates. The 1,990‑sq/ft property, which features two bathrooms, a reception room, a utility room, a lift, parking, and a communal garden, is in need of modernization. Buyers who extend the lease (a process estimated to cost between £3.35 million and £4.5 million for a 90‑year lease) could see its value soar to around £6 million. Estate agents stress that while such opportunities are rare in this prestigious area, the high cost for a lease extension is a significant consideration."

With the climax of the previous episode being the announcement of the pregnancy, it is quite a jump to the start of tomorrow’s instalment where Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, talks about being eight months pregnant . As Sunday night’s latest heartthrob, women across the country have voiced their longing to settle down with Poldark – but unfortunately it seems as if his heart is well and truly off the market . Their fast relationship didn't go unnoticed by fans. One posted on Twitter: ‘If you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes’ It is reminiscent of the show’s previous pregnancy that saw Elizabeth, another contender for Ross’s affection, go to full term in the gap between two episodes. This didn’t go unnoticed by fans, who posted on Twitter: ‘Poldark is rather good, would watch the next one now. Though if you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.’","The passage outlines a controversial plot development in Poldark. Demelza Poldark, who was barely showing her pregnancy last week, is now depicted as being eight months pregnant and quickly gives birth in the upcoming episode—a timeline that fans find hard to believe. Meanwhile, Ross Poldark (played by Aidan Turner) is shown as a devoted father and a romantic figure, although his heart remains unavailable for a new relationship. Fans have noted and joked about the show's rapid pregnancy progress, comparing it to previous instances within the series."

research by the world health organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the uk could suffer learning , behavioural and physical problems such as deformed limbs because of exposure to alcohol , according to the sunday people . 
that equates to about 7,500 every year .

tip of the iceberg : research by the world health organisation suggests that at least one in 100 babies born in the uk could suffer learning and behavioural problems because of exposure to alcohol in the womb
one teenager who was born with foetal alcohol syndrome is 15-year-old niamh brown . 
she needs help getting dressed , has no sense of danger and will never be able to live independently . 
niamh was three when her adoptive parents julia and simon first noticed something was wrong . 
she stuggled at playschool , having difficulty holding a pencil and paying attention . 
two years later , at the age of five , niamh was diagnosed with foetal alcohol syndrome from her birth mother 's drinking . 
in 2007 , julia and simon set up the foetal alcohol spectrum disorder trust to help others . 
other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver , kidneys and heart , cerebral palsy , sight loss and epilepsy . 
pregnant women are advised by the government not to drink alcohol . 
if they do , the maximum consumption recommended is up to two units no more than twice a week . 
but ms mitchell believes the guidance should be changed so that women are advised not to drink at all during pregnancy .","The passage reports that 272 children disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were admitted to hospitals in England over the past year, though experts warn that many more could be affected. Research by the World Health Organization indicates that roughly one in every 100 UK babies—about 7,500 annually—might suffer from a range of learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure in the womb. Through the example of 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who faces lifelong challenges as a result of the syndrome, the article emphasizes that children with this condition do not improve over time. It also notes that while pregnant women are currently advised to limit their alcohol intake (up to two units twice a week), advocates like Elizabeth Mitchell argue that the guidance should be revised to recommend complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. ""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said. ""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. ""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. ""Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. ""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. "" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. ""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. ""With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. ""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. "" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. ""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. ""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. ""Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. ""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. "" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. ""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. ""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. ""Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. ""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added. ""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. ""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. ""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. ""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""","Scotland’s women’s team, undefeated in all five qualifiers, is set to host unbeaten Iceland at Falkirk Stadium—a win that would almost guarantee their spot in next summer’s finals in the Netherlands. Forward Evans, determined to avoid the play-off heartbreak of previous campaigns, stresses the emotional cost of missing out while acknowledging Iceland’s strength. She also highlights how having 12 players competing in top leagues abroad, including her own successful stint with Bayern Munich, is bolstering the national team’s competitiveness and overall growth."

he states that the landing gear has not been deployed and at that very moment the plane touches down with a bump and scratches along the tarmac .

the plane 's propellers can be heard ricocheting off the ground as the wings bounce up and down from the impact
the video maker can be heard saying that the plane 's propellers have been damaged in the collision with the runway and that more than likely , the pilot will crash . 
he later said : ` i was walking down the flight line of aircraft that flew in for the day , which is close to the main runway and noticed this light twin aircraft coming in low . 
` i noticed he did not have his landing gear down and thought he was going to do a fly-by , but then noticed the power was pulled back with the aircraft approaching for a landing with no landing gear . 
the plane scratches along the runway and the video maker describes the sound as ` one you will not forget '
` the belly and tips of the propellers impacted the runway ( the sound of the propellers hitting the surface was one sound you will not forget ) . 
` once the pilot realized his mistake , he gave what appeared to be full throttle and both propellers pulled the front of the aircraft down with the propellers making a second impact with the runway . 
` somehow the engines stayed on and running and the pilot was able to regain control while leaving the airport . 
the video maker noted that once the pilot realized his mistake he began re-engaging the engine
he added : ` it 's amazing the aeroplane engines did not get destroyed during the propellers impact and the pilot did not stall during the forced take-off with the high angle of attack and damaged propellers . ' 
according to wpbf 25 news , the plane 's pilot , chris georgaklis , 85 , managed to fly 100 miles to fort lauderdale after the incident and landed safely .

people look on as the damaged aircraft takes off from the runway and flies 100 miles to fort lauderdale , where it landed safely
the most common cause of a gear-up landing , also known as a belly landing or pancake landing , is human error -- when the pilot simply forgets to deploy the landing gear before touchdown . 
another cause is mechanical fault , when an electric motor or a hydraulic actuator fails . 
the faa is said to be investigating the incident .","The passage describes a gear-up landing incident captured on video in Fort Pierce, Florida. A light general aviation aircraft, approaching the Aero Acres Residential Airpark, touched down without its landing gear deployed.

12-3,"The magnitude-4.8 quake struck at a depth of 15.5km (9.6 miles) 35km north of the city of Lucca, officials said. The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.","A magnitude-4.8 earthquake hit 35 km north of Lucca at a depth of 15.5 km, with its epicentre in Garfagnana at 15:48 local time. The quake, which produced several smaller aftershocks, was felt in cities including Milan, Florence, Bologna, Modena, and Lucca, prompting school evacuations and causing disruptions to phone and power services in the affected area. While there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage, the incident occurs in a region prone to quakes—recalling the deadly 2009 L’Aquila quake and a recent pair of events that left over 20 fatalities—and follows previous controversies over misleading safety reassurances before major earthquakes."
